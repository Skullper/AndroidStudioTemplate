# AndroidStudioTemplate
Android Studio template for easy implementing MVP pattern into your projects.

1. Create project with BaseArch template. // Please do not change names of base files. It will add you problems when you'll be creating activities and fragments.

2. If you want to create new activity just go to File->New->MVP->NewActivity.

3. If you want to create new fragment - File->New->MVP->NewFragment.

4. Good luck.
