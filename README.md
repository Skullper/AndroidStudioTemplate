# AndroidStudioTemplate
Android Studio template for easy implementing MVP pattern into your projects.

!!! IMPORTANT !!! Before you start paste folders (BaseArch, NewActivity and NewFragment) into your_path_to_android_studio/plugins/android/lib/templates/activities. !!! IMPORTANT !!!

1. Create project with BaseArch template. // Please do not change names of base files. It will add you problems when you'll be creating activities and fragments.

2. If you want to create new activity just go to File->New->MVP->NewActivity.

3. If you want to create new fragment - File->New->MVP->NewFragment.

4. Good luck.
